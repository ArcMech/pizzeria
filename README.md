# First project written by myself :)

I've projected and written this page from scratch.
Designed in Figma, then coded in pure html, sass and vanillaJS.

During my work I've learned a lot:

- usage of GIT, basic commands
- data flow between functions
- storing data in arrays
- DOM manipulations
- displaing html through js function
- creating and usage of objects
- putting data into local storage
- usage of webpack, basic configuration of it

## There was a lot of obstacles:

One function spent me 2 weeks to figure it out, what the problem is (it was a function of updating array). I had a problem with adding function with summing a price. The biggest one was with delivery button and its flow (buttons in shopping card had worked, even if they weren't displayed.)

# Future improvements for next projects:

- I'm using too much CSS. I need to design thing with repeatable components, have to use mixins in sass and code less (DRY),
- I should predict, which function I can use versatile with just passing parameters,
- Need to better plan my time.
